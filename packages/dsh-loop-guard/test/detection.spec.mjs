/**
 * Detection regressions for the issue #1 re-test.
 *
 * Issue #1 (jilian-dsh, dsh 0.1.2-rc.1) reported that after the `inject` fix the
 * plugin loaded and fired, but the reasoning loop RECURRED. The v0.1.3 detector
 * had two blind spots that together miss that shape, and these tests pin both:
 *
 *  1. it required CONSECUTIVE reasoning-only calls and reset on any text output;
 *  2. its only content signal was intra-call verbatim n-gram repetition, so a
 *     model that restates the same stalled conclusion in new words scored ~0.
 *
 * The fix for (2) was a cross-call containment rule, and it was originally joined
 * by an intra-call ratio rule (`low-entropy`) that measured badly and has since
 * been removed. The bottom of this file pins that removal.
