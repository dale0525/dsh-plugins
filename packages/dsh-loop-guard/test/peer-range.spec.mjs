/**
 * Guard the peer range by *computing* admission, not by pattern-matching it.
 *
 * v0.1.6 shipped a test that merely asserted the range string contained
 * `0.1.2-rc.N` and `0.1.5-(alpha|beta|rc).N`. That form cannot tell a correct
 * range from an incorrect one — it fails only on a *different-looking* string —
 * and so it certified a range that was already wrong: the shipped
 * `>=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0 || >=0.1.5-alpha.1 <0.2.0` admits only the 0.1.2-rc and
 * 0.1.5 tuples, because a semver comparator admits a prerelease only when some
 * comparator in the same group shares that prerelease's major.minor.patch
 * tuple. The 0.1.3-alpha.2 line and the whole 0.1.6 line were excluded, so a
 * user on the newest shipped dsh line got
 *
 *   npm error ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree
 *   npm error peer @deepseek-ai/dsh-agent@">=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0 || ..." from
 *   npm error   dsh-loop-guard@0.1.6
 *
 * for a plugin whose suite passes on that line. The dsh packages are *peers*, so
 * the range cannot be papered over with `--legacy-peer-deps`: the install simply
 * fails.
 *
 * Asserting the admitted set *exactly* makes both failure directions loud: a
 * range that quietly drops a supported line fails the equality below, and a
 * range that quietly admits an untested line fails it too.
