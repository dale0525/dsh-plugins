/**
 * The line-repeat rule — the phrase-pool bleed that the cycle rule cannot see.
 *
 * The cycle rule (`reasoning-breaker.spec.mjs`) only catches a bleed whose unit
 * repeats in the same order every time. A real reproduction broke that
 * assumption: 330 188 reasoning characters drawn from roughly eleven sentences —
 * `Let me read the section.` / `Executing.` / `Go.` / `Now.` / `Writing.` /
 * `OK.` / `Let me write.` — reshuffled on every pass, so the text has **no period
 * at any cap**:
 *
 *   - measured span with `trailingCycle(tail, cap, 512)`: 0 at every cap from
 *     64 to 4096;
 *   - the minimum period of the trailing 8192 characters was 6767, i.e. none.
 *
 * The cycle rule was therefore blind to it and the turn ran to 330 188
 * characters — "都快几百K输出了" — until the user aborted by hand. Raising the
 * cap cannot help: there is no period to find at any cap, which is why the
 * earlier cap bumps (64 → 256 → 512) never fixed this shape.
 *
 * What the bleed does have is a tiny **line vocabulary**. Counting how much of
 * the text sits in lines already seen separates it cleanly, and the two rules
 * are complementary rather than redundant: short-phrase bleeds (`Go.`, `OK.`,
 * under `LINE_MIN_CHARS`) are the cycle rule's job, long-phrase pools are this
 * one's.
 *
 * Calibration, on the real session (146 reasoning calls: 17 aborted bleeds,
 * 119 that produced text or a tool call):
 *
 *   - the shipped thresholds cut the 330 188-character bleed at **3264
 *     characters — 1.0 %** of its final length;
 *   - **0 false positives on all 119 producing calls**, and 0 across every
 *     parameter set the shipped one was chosen from (252 qualifying sets);
 *   - the control samples below are the *longest* producing calls in that
 *     session, i.e. the hardest negatives available.
 *
 * Runs against the built `lib/index.js`, so it pins the shipped artifact.
