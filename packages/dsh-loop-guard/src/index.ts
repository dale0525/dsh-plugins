/**
 * Thinking-loop guard for the dsh harness.
 *
 * Closes a guard-layer gap the in-tree `guard/` family does not cover.
 * `guard/timeout-policy` is a per-tool `tools/execute` deadline and
 * `guard/repeat-tool-reminder` is a same-tool-call chain detector — only a tool
 * *call* arms either. When a model degrades into a pure-thinking loop
 * (`deepseek-v4.1-flash-expires-on-0910` under `max`/`high` reasoning effort and
 * a long context), it emits only `reasoning-delta` chunks — zero `text-delta`,
 * zero `tool-call-delta` — so neither fires, `turn()` never sets `turnEnds`, and
 * the agent-loop `while (true)` never breaks until the user manually aborts.
 *
 * This plugin observes the public `llm/stream` waterfall (present on dsh
 * **0.1.2-rc.1 and 0.1.5-alpha.1**), tallies the `StreamChunk` composition of
 * each loop-built model call, and escalates through a configured reaction.
 *
 * Why `llm/stream` and not `agent/assistant-stream`: the latter (scoped emit
 * with `start`/`chunk`/`end` frames) only exists from dsh 0.1.5-alpha.1; the
 * widely-installed 0.1.2-rc.1 has neither it nor `AssistantStreamFrame`, so a
 * plugin pinned to that seam silently no-ops on the common release. `llm/stream`
 * is a Cordis waterfall around every streaming model call in both versions and
 * carries the same `StreamChunk` delta types, and its `GenerateOptions` carries
 * `sessionId`, from which the live Agent is reachable via `ctx.agents.get(...)`.
 *
 * ## Detection (two per-call shapes, plus two in-call breakers)
 *
 * Issue #1's re-test on dsh 0.1.2-rc.1 showed the v0.1.2 detector did not fire on
 * the reproduction: the loop recurred with the plugin loaded and working. The
 * v0.1.2 detector had two blind spots that together miss the reported shape:
 *
 *  1. It required **consecutive** reasoning-only calls and reset the counter on
 *     *any* text output. A loop whose steps each emit some (boilerplate) text
 *     after their reasoning never accumulates, because every step looks like
 *     progress.
 *  2. Its only content signal was `repeatRatio` — verbatim n-gram repetition
 *     *within one call*. A model that re-derives the same stalled conclusion with
 *     different wording every step scores near zero on that measure, so it also
 *     slipped through.
 *
 * The fix for (2) is a **cross-call** measure: the **containment** of the
 * previous call's distinct n-grams in this call's. A step is "stalled" when it
 * either produced no output at all (shape 1) *or* it repeats most of the previous
 * step's distinct reasoning material (shape 2 — the same conclusion reworded,
 * which is what a stuck model actually does). Anything else is genuine progress
 * and resets the run.
 *
 * The intra-call ratio itself turned out not to be salvageable as a signal and is
 * no longer wired in; {@link LoopDetector.observe} carries the measurement.
 *
 * ## Mid-stream repetition (issue #2848, v0.1.6)
 *
 * The three shapes above are judged **after** a model call ends, which is
 * structurally too late for the failure in issue #2848: a ~10-minute, 420,000
 * character bleed where the model repeated one sentence across ~2825 text chunks
 * — all inside a **single** call. No per-call detector can help, because there is
 * no call boundary to react at; the harness must intervene mid-stream.
 *
 * `maxRepeatedText` therefore adds an intra-call breaker: count consecutive
 * identical normalized `text-delta` payloads and, on the Nth, **end the stream
 * from inside the `llm/stream` wrapper** by yielding a terminal `finish` chunk
 * and returning. Two facts make that expressible and safe, both verified on
 * 0.1.5-alpha.1 and re-checked against the 0.1.2-rc.1 typings:
 *
 *  - The agent loop consumes the waterfall's iterable (`for await (const chunk
 *    of stream) live.push(chunk)`), so a listener's own chunk reaches the same
 *    assembler as an adapter's.
 *  - `packages/llm/llm/src/invariant.ts` requires a terminal finish chunk and
 *    explicitly permits an `error`/`aborted` finish with blocks still open — so
 *    a mid-call cut is a sanctioned protocol outcome, not a violation. A stream
 *    that simply ends is an invariant failure, which is why the breaker emits a
 *    finish rather than merely returning.
 *
 * The break is always an `error` finish carrying `REPETITIVE_OUTPUT`: it fails
 * the step through the loop's normal error path (and the `agent/request-error`
 * waterfall, where a retry policy may act on the code). A quiet `stop` is not
 * offered, because the breaker fires with the call's text block still open and
 * the invariant admits only `error`/`aborted` finishes in that state — measured,
 * not assumed. `breakCorrection` steers the agent so the resumed turn is told
 * what happened. Deliberately **no model fallback and no automatic retry**: a
 * degenerate model must not be silently re-billed.
 *
 * ## Cycled repetition (discussion #7043, v0.1.8)
 *
 * `maxRepeatedText` compares *deltas*, so it only covers the period-1 case: the
 * same payload emitted over and over. The #7043 report is a **cycle** — a few
 * short lines rotating ("好。 / 发。 / 好。 / 好。", and a mixed-language variant
 * with "Emitting." in front) for tens of lines, and the same signature in a long
 * session where the model bleeds instead of calling the tool it obviously means
 * to call. Measured against the shipped v0.1.7 detector, that shape **never
 * fires under any of four chunkings** (one delta per line, per cycle, per four
 * characters, per character) within 40 repeats: the longest run of identical
 * consecutive deltas is 3, against a threshold of 60.
 *
 * `maxRepeatedCycleChars` / `minRepeatedCycleChars` add the missing rule at the
 * character level: when the tail of the call's visible output is an exact
 * repetition of one period no longer than `maxRepeatedCycleChars` and spanning
 * at least `minRepeatedCycleChars`, the stream is cut by the same terminal
 * `error` finish. Character-level because the shape does not depend on line
 * breaks — a provider that streams the same bleed with no newline at all is
 * caught identically — and because the reported period is short (12 and 26
 * characters for the two reported shapes).
 *
 * Why exactness and not a low-entropy ratio, when `repeatRatio` was already in
 * the file: measured on the same texts, a *coverage* measure reads 0.92-0.99 for
 * the two reported shapes at a 512-character tail but 0.72 for a 40-row
 * markdown table, 0.76 for a log listing, 0.82 for generated CSS rows and 0.84
 * for a JSON dump. Separating "degenerate" from "legitimately repetitive" by
 * 0.06 is not a margin worth truncating a user's call over; verbatim
 * periodicity is 0 for every one of those samples.
 *
 * ## Reaction
 *
 * On a threshold crossing it applies `escalate`. Unlike v0.1.2 it does **not**
 * latch after one reaction: a single steer often does not break a strong loop
 * (which is exactly what issue #1's re-test observed), so the run counter resets
 * and re-fires after another `maxThinkingSteps`, up to `maxFires` times.
 *
 * Mechanism notes (verified against packages/core/agent-loop/src/agent.ts,
 * packages/llm/llm/src/index.ts, and packages/core/agent/src/runtime-types.ts on
 * dsh 0.1.5-alpha.1; the `llm/stream` / `StreamChunk` / `ctx.agents.get` trio is
 * present unchanged on 0.1.2-rc.1):
 *  - `llm/stream` is a waterfall; a listener wraps `next()` and sees each chunk.
 *  - `chunk: StreamChunk` distinguishes `reasoning-delta` / `text-delta` /
 *    `tool-call-delta` (packages/llm/llm/src/types.ts).
 *  - Loop-built requests carry `markAgentLoopRequest`; `isAgentLoopRequest`
 *    filters out arbitrary non-agent streaming (tool streams, etc.).
 *  - `options.sessionId` → `ctx.agents.get(sessionId)` yields the live `Agent`.
 *  - `agent.steer(message)`, `agent.inject(message)`, and `agent.cancel(cause)`
 *    are public methods; a listener can react but not veto an in-flight step.
 *
 * ## Reasoning bleed (issue #5976, v0.1.9)
 *
 * The three per-call shapes above all assume the call eventually **ends**. #5976
 * is the case where it does not: the model degrades into a pure reasoning bleed
 * — no `text-delta`, no `tool-call-delta` — and keeps generating indefinitely.
 * The harness derives `StepEndReason` from the finished message
 * (`packages/core/agent-loop`, `step()` returns `completed` only once a message
 * exists), so a stream that never finishes never settles the step, `turnEnds`
 * stays null, and the `while (true)` turn loop never breaks. The reporter's
 * experience — "只能手动中止" — is that loop.
 *
 * Every detector above is therefore blind to it by construction:
 *
 *  - {@link LoopDetector} judges a call after it ends, and this one does not end;
 *  - {@link TextRepetitionDetector} watches visible output, and this failure
 *    emits none — deliberately, since reasoning is where the bleed lives and
 *    reasoning legitimately revisits itself far more often.
 *
 * {@link ReasoningLoopBreaker} closes it with the only mechanism that can: it
 * watches `reasoning-delta`, and on a verbatim cycle it ends the stream from
 * inside the `llm/stream` wrapper with a terminal `error` finish. That failure
 * is what makes the turn end at all — `agent-loop`'s `step()` turns a non-retried
 * `error` finish into a thrown `LlmError`, `turn()` catches it into
 * `turnEnds = { kind: 'error' }`, and the `finally` appends `turn/end`.
 *
 * The rule is exact periodicity, not a ratio, and the thresholds are measured
 * rather than guessed — see {@link ReasoningLoopBreaker} for the calibration
 * against a real reproduction.

   *
   * ## Why the default is 512 and not 64
   *
   * The same silent-failure rule that set the reasoning cap applies here, and
   * this side was left behind. Measured on a real 44 387-character visible-output
   * bleed: its exact minimal period is **172** characters (stable across every
   * tail window from 512 to 16 384), and the loop starts at character **139 —
   * 0.3 %** of the final text. At the old `64` default `trailingCycle` returned
   * **0** for it, so the guard never fired, the call was never cut, and the text
   * ran to 44 387 characters until the user stopped the turn by hand.
   *
   * A streaming replay of that text through {@link TextRepetitionDetector} — the
   * real detector, delta by delta, not the settled message — puts the candidate
   * caps side by side. The figures are for that ONE text:
   *
   * | cap | fires on it |
   * | --- | --- |
   * | 64 (shipped) | **0** |
   * | 128 | 0 |
   * | 256 | 1, cut at character 576 (1.3 %) |
   * | 512 | 1, cut at character 576 (1.3 %) |
   *
   * `512` is chosen over the bare-minimum `256` for the same reason the reasoning
   * side chose it: a cap below a real period fails *silently*, and the periods
   * seen on this side have already grown past a previous default once. It costs
   * nothing in precision — across every visible-output text in the session store
   * (2 973 texts of 1 500+ characters, all sessions) the cycle rule fires on
   * exactly one: the real bleed. The other 2 972 legitimate texts — reports,

   * ## Why there is no intra-call ratio rule here
   *
   * An earlier version added a third reason, `low-entropy`: `repeatRatio` at or
   * above `0.5` on a call that did produce output. It was removed after being
   * measured on a real 4380-record session, where it fired **12 times and not
   * once on a loop**:
   *
   *  - Of the 36 calls it judged across those 12 fires, **33 (92 %)** were calls
   *    that had just made a tool call — `edit`, `write`, `read`, `grep`, `pwsh`.
   *    **Zero** were calls that produced neither output nor a tool call.
   *  - Across the whole session, on the 152 calls that produced output, it fired
   *    on **91 (59.9 %)**.
   *  - No threshold rescues it: the highest ratio on a productive call is
   *    **0.797** and the lowest on a reasoning-only call is **0.308**, so the
   *    ranges overlap and no cut-off separates them. At `0.5` it flags 60 % of
   *    productive calls; at `0.8` it flags none but also misses half the real
   *    bleeds.
   *  - The reason is arithmetic, not tuning. `repeatRatio` counts 4-grams
   *    already seen; the distinct 4-gram count of natural language saturates, so
   *    the ratio is pushed up by **length**. Scoring one continuous
   *    non-repeating English document at growing prefixes gives 0.290 at 2048
   *    characters, 0.495 at 8000, 0.629 at 20 000 — and the repo's own
   *    `README_EN.md` and `src/index.ts` score 0.54-0.65, i.e. above the
   *    threshold, while a genuine periodic loop scores 0.994-0.999. Spearman
   *    rho(length, ratio) = 0.606.
   *
   * So the rule was not a loop detector but a "reasoning longer than roughly
   * 8000 characters" detector. Its cost was not only the wrong steers: `fires` is
   * a per-agent budget, so four false positives exhausted `maxFires` and left the
   * guard silent for the rest of the process — the failure recorded in
   * {@link ReasoningLoopBreaker}'s calibration notes, where the three real bleeds
   * of a reproduction drew no reaction at all.
   *
   * The two reasons that remain are both structural and were clean on the same
   * data: `reasoning-only` fired on 0 of 152 productive calls, and
   * `repeated-material` needs 80 % of the previous call's distinct material
   * restated.
   *
   * @param step - the call's output shape and reasoning text.
   * @returns the reason it counted as stalled, or `undefined` when it was progress.

 *    line in a generated document.
 *
 * The scan stops as soon as the minimum is met, so the returned span is

/**
 * The reasoning breaker: the one rule that can end a thinking loop.
 *
 * ## Why this exists separately from every other detector here
 *
 * Issue #5976's failure is a model that degrades into a **pure reasoning bleed**
 * and never returns: no `text-delta`, no `tool-call-delta`, so the step never
 * settles. Measured on a real reproduction (a 174 MB session, 4628 calls, dsh
 * 0.1.5-rc.2), the final three calls emitted 74 193 / 357 112 / 134 244
 * characters of reasoning and nothing else.
 *
 * Every other detector in this file is structurally too late for that shape:
 *
 *  - {@link LoopDetector} judges a call **after** it ends. A bleed that does not
 *    end never reaches it. On the reproduction its `maxFires` budget was already
 *    spent by four false positives early in the session (the `low-entropy` rule,
 *    since removed — see {@link LoopDetector.observe}), so the three real bleeds
 *    produced no reaction at all.
 *  - {@link TextRepetitionDetector} watches `text-delta` only, by design, because
 *    visible output is what a repetition is normally visible in. Here the bleed
 *    is entirely in reasoning, so it never saw a chunk.
 *
 * The harness itself has no seam for this either: `packages/core/agent-loop`
 * derives `StepEndReason` from the finished message, so a stream that keeps
 * producing reasoning never settles and the `while (true)` turn loop never
 * breaks — which is exactly what the reporter observed as "只能手动中止".
 *
 * ## Why it is safe to watch reasoning, which legitimately revisits itself
 *
 * The rule is the same **exact verbatim periodicity** as the visible-output
 * cycle rule, not a low-entropy ratio. Calibrated against real reproductions —
 * every call with >= 2048 reasoning characters, of which the overwhelming
 * majority produced text or a tool call:
 *
 *  - Measured bleed periods: **89, 102, 105, 154, 187, 235 and 409** characters.
 *  - `maxPeriod: 64` (the shipped visible-output default) finds **none** of them.
 *  - The period cap must sit **above every observed period**, not in the middle
 *    of the ones seen so far: a cap below a real period fails *silently* —
 *    `trailingCycle` returns 0, the breaker never fires, and the turn runs until
 *    the user aborts it. A `256` default did exactly that to the 409-character
 *    bleed. Hence `512`.
 *  - Verbatim periodicity is what separates a bleed from legitimately repetitive
 *    reasoning: the highest-`repeatRatio` non-loop calls have *no* period at
 *    all, so a ratio rule would flag them while the exact rule does not.
 *
 * Free of Cordis types so the decision rule is unit-testable without a harness.

   * End one in-flight model call from inside the stream wrapper.
   *
   * ## Why the call is closed, not failed
   *
   * An earlier version ended the call with a terminal `error` finish. That is
   * legal at the stream level — `llm/invariant` permits `error`/`aborted` to
   * leave blocks open — but it produces a session shape the rest of the harness
   * cannot handle, in two independent ways:
   *
   *  1. **The client cannot render it.** `agent-loop` settles an `error` finish
   *     as an `assistant/attempt` and appends no `assistant/message`
   *     (`step()`, the `finish.kind === 'error' || 'aborted'` branch). The
   *     conversation renderer builds its `assistant-step` node from a settled
   *     message, so it returns `null` for that step — and
   *     `buildTargetUpserts` refuses to withdraw a target it already
   *     materialized, throwing `conversation Definition "assistant-step"
   *     withdrew materialized target "chat"`. A reasoning-only break has no
   *     visible content to fall back on, so every break crashed the UI.
   *  2. **The turn could never continue.** The same branch ends in
   *     `throwError(error)`, so `turn()` throws out of the loop *before* it
   *     reaches `if (!this.inbox.hasPending) return false` — the line that
   *     decides whether another turn opens. A queued steer was therefore never
   *     claimed, which is why a break looked like "it just stopped".
   *
   * Closing the open blocks and finishing with `stop` instead puts the call on
   * the ordinary path: `step()` assembles `live.blocks()` into a real
   * `assistant/message`, the client renders it, and `turn()` returns normally so
   * pending steering opens the next turn.
   *
   * The invariant requires `open.size === 0` for a `stop` finish, which is
   * exactly what closing the blocks establishes.
   *
   * @param agent - the live agent that owns the call.
   * @param chars - characters emitted before the break.
   * @param rule - which detector fired.
   * @param open - the blocks still open, in stream order, with their text.
   * @returns the terminal chunks to yield, or `null` when the break cannot be
   *   made safe and the stream should be left alone.
