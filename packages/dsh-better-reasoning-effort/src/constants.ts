 * Model-level provenance marker written beside every ladder the HOST autofill

 *
 * It exists because the plugin's auto-fill and the user's staged declaration
 * race on the SAME row: whichever half runs the fill writes the knowledge base
 * suggestion, while the staged-declaration flush compares the document against
 * its own suggestion. By the time the flush looks, the suggestion may already
 * be stored -- and byte equality alone cannot tell "the plugin wrote this" from
 * "the user declared this", so a staged ladder differing from the knowledge
 * base in even one spelling (the editor's `off: null` against the knowledge
 * base's `off: 'none'`) was dropped as a document takeover: the reported
 * "configured it on the add-provider card, saved, and it is gone".
 *
 * With the marker the flush knows the stored ladder is a suggestion, so a
 * staged user intent overrides it. Either way the user's bytes win; the marker
 * only decides whether the flush is allowed to write at all. Schemastery passes
 * unknown model keys through, so the marker survives official-page saves and
 * restarts like the other two markers. Any ladder written through the plugin
 * clears it, which is what makes a later hand edit outrank a fresh staging.
