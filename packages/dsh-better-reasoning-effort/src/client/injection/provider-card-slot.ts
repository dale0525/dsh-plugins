/**
 * The provider-card slot registration: the seat the request-header editor
 * (issue #12) renders in.
 *
 * `settings.models.provider-card` is a KEYED slot declared by the official
 * Models section, dispatched on each card's owning settings namespace
 * (`ProviderDirectoryEntry.settingsNs`). Registering under `llm-pi-ai` is
 * therefore all it takes to receive every card of this adapter family — the
 * shipped routes, the ones the user adds, and the hand-declared ones alike —
 * without a DOM anchor, a mutation observer, or a label to match on.
 *
 * The ROUTE is not a registration-time fact: the section passes each occurrence
 * its directory row as owner props, so the route arrives on the component at
 * render time and one registration serves every card.
 *
