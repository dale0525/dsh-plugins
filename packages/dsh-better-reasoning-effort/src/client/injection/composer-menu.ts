/**
 * The composer model menu injection: the reasoning-effort slider AND the model
 * search box, both mounted inside the OFFICIAL model menu opened from the
 * bottom-right seat. The seat's trigger is never touched — the official
 * "model · effort" display stays.
 *
 * This module is the single place that decides which pane the menu is showing,
 * where each foreign body sits, and when each one retires. The two pane probes
 * look alike but answer different questions, and must NOT be merged:
 *
 *   - the slider's probe — `[role="menuitemradio"]` — asks "did the official
 *     drill-in replace my replica body?". The effort pane matches too, which
 *     is fine: our body belongs to the root pane either way.
 *   - the search's probe — `section[role="group"]` — asks "is there a
 *     filterable model list here?". The effort pane has no groups, so a
 *     role-based probe would mount a search box over a list it cannot filter.

 * computed from the PRE-injection height: the slider replica is still shown
 * and the search box not yet mounted, which floated the card ~56px above the
 * trigger. Both edits are done synchronously by the callers (the injected
 * roots commit inside `flushSync`, the replica is hidden inline), so this
 * flushSync-wrapped `resize` lets the official `place()` re-measure and commit
 * BEFORE the browser paints — no intermediate frame is ever shown. Waiting for
 * a later frame (the previous implementation) is exactly what made the menu
 * visibly jump.
 *
 * Only the official effect ever writes the card's position: this module still
 * adds no class and no inline style of its own.
 *
 * COUPLING (deliberate, and the reason there is no geometry code here): this
 * works only because the official card re-runs its `place()` on a window
 * `resize` and commits the result through React state. A kernel that switches
 * to `requestAnimationFrame` placement or writes the position outside React
 * would leave this a no-op — the menu would keep the pre-injection `top`
 * instead of jumping, i.e. it would degrade back to the mis-anchored (not
 * broken) state the earlier fixes describe, never to a crash.
