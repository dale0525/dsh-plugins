/**
 * Wire-surface types the browser half consumes: the settings Remote faces and
 * the pure seam the effort editor needs. The compilation baseline is the
 * 0.1.6-alpha.2 kernel line (a downgrade retry for older kernels' narrower
 * compat schema is kept as a safety net):
 * the browser talks to the generated Typert
 * `ctx.remote.settings` stub — `describe()` takes no argument, `mutate` takes
 * positional `(ns, ops, expectedRevision)`, and every answer is the envelope
 * `{ok, value | error}` with refusals coded `settings/conflict` /
 * `settings/rejected` / `gateway/*`.
 *
 * The vocabulary views come from the official re-exports (`SettingsNamespaceView`
 * / `SettingsPathOpView` / `SettingsDescribeValue`; the model-directory types
 * from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-api-session-controller/types`), so a kernel change to
 * those shapes shows up at typecheck rather than at runtime. The answer
 * envelope is declared structurally — the official `RemoteResult` folds the
 * typert-wide `RemoteErrorDetailsMap` merges, whose consumer-side declarations
 * live in the settings-controller package; pinning that package here would
 * widen the plugin's type graph for one refusal shape.
